* custom allocators and EnTT allocator-aware in general (long term feature, I don't actually need it at the moment) - see #22
* scene management (I prefer the concept of spaces, that is a kind of scene anyway)
* review doc: separate it in multiple md/dox files, reduce the readme to a minimum and provide users with links to the online documentation on gh-pages
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* dynamic view, useful for runtime ecs, can be filled with the desired pool at runtime and are not constrained to a compile-time list of components
* define basic reactive systems (track entities to which component is attached, track entities from which component is removed, and so on)
* define systems as composable mixins (initializazion, reactive, update, whatever) with flexible auto-detected arguments (registry, views, etc)
* create dedicated flat map based on types implementation (sort of "type map") for types to use within the registry and so on...
* ease the assignment of tags as string (type-less assign member function + user defined literal for hashed strings)
* config system with atomic (something like Config<"foobar"_hs>::set(true) and Config<"foobar"_hs>::get<bool>())
* work stealing job system (see #100)
* C++17. That's all.
* AOB
